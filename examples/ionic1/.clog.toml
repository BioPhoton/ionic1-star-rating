# The preferred way to set a constant changelog. This file will be read for old changelog
# data, then prepended to for new changelog data. It's the equivilant to setting
# both infile and outfile to the same file.

# Defaults to stdout when omitted

# This sets an output file only! If it exists already, new changelog data will be

# This is useful in conjunction with the infile field if you have a separate file
# that you would like to append after newly created clog data
#
# Defaults to stdout when omitted

# This sets the input file old! Any data inside this file will be appended to any
